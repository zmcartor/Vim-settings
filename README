My .vimrc which was modified from the default JANUS distro.

Some notable mentions:

jk combo for ESC key
: mapped to ; . only one key instead of pressing shift
leader +p will perform php syntax check

Now using Solarized for vim colors instead of compoucher theme.
Added Syntastic checking for php, javascript and ruby
JSHint also included with :JSHint

Enjoy!
